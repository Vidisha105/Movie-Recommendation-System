# Recommendation-System
The report deals with the implementation of collaborative and content based filtering approaches to predict movie ratings of existing and new users.The survey data was split into training and test data for each model. In Part 1, prediction of ratings for the 3 movies that havenâ€™t been watched by any group members, User-User Non-normalised Euclidean Distance model turned out to be the best model with the lowest RMSE. In Part 2, prediction of the ratings for the 3 specific new movies yields the Item-Item non-normalised cosine as the best model based on RMSE. For Part-3 to predict the ratings for new customers is carried out with certain criteria like gender and demographics, wherein User User mean centered Cosine model outdid the other models based on the RMSE. User-User Non-normalised Cosine was used in Part 4 with the new information available about the customers.Scope for enhancing the prediction is also discussed.The scarcity and scalability issues limit the accuracy of the models  here which can be resolved by Single value decomposition and Principal Component Analysis. Content based filtering can be leveraged to better the prediction. Recommendation systems improve discovery experience for users and have immense potential for revenue generation.
